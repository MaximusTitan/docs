## Step-by-Step Guide

### Create Lesson Plan

The Lesson Plan Generator is a user-friendly and powerful tool that helps educators create structured and optimized lesson plans based on specific teaching requirements such as subject, topic, grade, lesson objectives, and duration.

### Upload Document (Optional)

Teachers can upload a supporting document, such as a textbook or curriculum in PDF format, to align the lesson with academic standards.

**What to do:** Upload a textbook, curriculum guide, or reference PDF (optional).

**Important Notes:**

- **Format:** PDF only
- **Size Limit:** Maximum 4.5MB
- **Tip:** Use this feature to ensure the generated lesson aligns with official curriculum material.

### Lesson Title

Enter a clear and descriptive title for your lesson. This helps define the focus of the lesson plan.

**What to do:** Enter the title of your lesson.

**Example:** The Life Cycle of Animals

### Session Duration (Minutes)

Specify the duration of each session in minutes. This determines how the lesson content will be broken down across sessions.

**What to do:** Specify how long each session will last, in minutes.

**Example:** 60

### Number of Sessions

Indicate how many sessions the lesson should be divided into. This helps structure the delivery of content over multiple classes.

**What to do:** Enter the total number of sessions you want for the lesson.

**Example:** 6

### Lesson Objectives

Clearly define what the lesson aims to achieve. List the main teaching goals—what concepts or skills students should learn during this lesson.

**What to do:** Clearly state the goals or key topics to be covered in the lesson.

**Example:**

- To introduce students to the concept of a life cycle and explain that all living beings go through different stages in life.
- To identify and describe the stages in the life cycle of different animals (e.g., butterfly, frog, hen, and human).
- To develop an understanding of metamorphosis and direct development.
- To enhance observation and comparison skills among students.
- To promote curiosity about nature and encourage respect for all forms of life.

### Learning Outcomes

Describe what students should be able to do, know, or demonstrate after completing the lesson. These outcomes should be measurable and aligned with the lesson objectives.

**What to do:** Describe what students should know or be able to do after completing the lesson.

**Example:**

- Define what a life cycle is and list the basic stages common to most animals (birth, growth, reproduction, death).
- Illustrate the life cycles of a butterfly, frog, hen, and human with diagrams.
- Differentiate between animals that undergo metamorphosis and those that don't.
- Use appropriate vocabulary such as metamorphosis, larva, pupa, and adult correctly.
- Explain the importance of each stage in the animal's life cycle.

### Additional Instructions

Include any specific notes, such as teaching methods, preferred tools, project ideas, required materials, or special instructions for assessments.

**What to do:** Add any special notes or preferences for your lesson plan.

**Example:**

- Use visual aids and animations (e.g., YouTube videos showing metamorphosis in butterflies and frogs).
- Include hands-on activities such as drawing and sequencing life cycle stages.
- Conduct a short quiz or group activity at the end of each session to reinforce learning.
- Link concepts with real-life observations (e.g., spotting a caterpillar, tadpole, or chick).
- Align lesson with the Maharashtra Board textbook (Environmental Studies, Class 4 - Part 1, Chapter related to "The Life Cycle of Animals").
- Encourage students to maintain a mini project notebook where they document life cycles in their environment.

### Generate Lesson Plan

Once all the information is filled in, click the "Generate Lesson Plan" button. The tool will automatically create a professional, curriculum-aligned plan complete with session-wise breakdowns, learning outcomes, activities, teaching aids, and assessments, saving preparation time while ensuring quality instruction.

**Final Step:** Click the "Generate Lesson Plan" button.

## After the Lesson Plan is Generated

Once your structured lesson plan is generated, the platform provides powerful features to review, manage, and deliver your sessions effectively. Here's how to use them:

### Session Flow Control

Manage how students access the sessions in your lesson plan.

**What to do:**

- Choose whether students can view all sessions at once or only in order.
- **Lock Session Flow**: Students must complete one session before moving to the next.
- **Unlock Session Flow**: Students can access all sessions freely.

> **Tip**: Locking sessions helps ensure students follow the intended learning path step by step.
